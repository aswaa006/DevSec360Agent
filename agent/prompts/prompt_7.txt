Analyze the following code extract and its vulnerability:

File: C:/Users/ASWATH/AppData/Local/Temp/tmpur14x3wf/uploaded/vuln_py.py
Lines: 0 to 0

Vulnerability Description: Detected the use of eval(). eval() can be dangerous if used to evaluate dynamic content. If this content can be input from outside the program, this may be a code injection vulnerability. Ensure evaluated content is not definable by external sources.

Full File Code:
# vuln_python.py — safe, intentionally insecure patterns for testing
import subprocess
import pickle
import os

# 1) shell=True usage (Bandit should flag)
def list_files_bad():
    # safe command but shell=True is insecure; bandit will flag
    subprocess.call("echo 'listing files' && dir", shell=True)

# 2) use of eval on user input (Semgrep/Bandit will flag)
def calculate(expression):
    # insecure: eval on input
    return eval(expression)

# 3) pickle.loads usage on untrusted data (dangerous pattern flagged)
def unsafe_deserialize(s):
    # Do NOT call this with untrusted data in real apps
    return pickle.loads(s)

# 4) hard-coded credential (Semgrep will flag patterns like 'password = "..."')

TASK:
- Confirm if the vulnerability exists at the mentioned location.
- Compare the entire file's logic with and without the vulnerability.
- Update the code to remove the vulnerability while preserving the logic of the file.
- After modification, ensure the main code logic still works and the vulnerability is removed.
- Do NOT introduce new features or change other logic. Only resolve the specified vulnerability.
- IMPORTANT: Respond with ONLY the full, updated contents of the Python file as valid code.
- Do NOT wrap the code in markdown, text, or explanations.
- At the very end of the file, append a short Python comment block summarizing:
    * The vulnerability fixed.
    * The changes made.
    * Why the original logic is preserved.
- Do not include any other commentary outside that final comment block.
